Nim solutions of Advent of Code 2019.

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019 problems.

Using Nim to solve these problems is certainly the wrong choice if you want to build a solution quickly. As a statically typed language, Nim lacks the flexibility of dynamic languages such as Python or Ruby. You have to declare your types, your variables and specify the type of the parameters of your procedures, all things which take some time. So, if you use Nim, donâ€™t expect to be among the best performers even if you are able to find the right algorithm very quickly (which is not my case). But you can have great pleasure to write code in this elegant language.
